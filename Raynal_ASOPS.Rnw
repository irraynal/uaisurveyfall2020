Unauthorized\footnote{Much of this paper discusses the difference between ``illegal`` and ``undocumented`` immigrant.  I am using the term ``unauthorized`` to refer generally to this group in order to separate my reference to this population from the two terms I am analyzing.}  immigration is a hotly debated issue in the United States.  In this debate, some people – especially partisans – use different language to frame their arguments.  This transforms the debate to not just one about immigration policy, but also about how to discuss and frame this issue.  For example, people disagree over whether ``illegal immigrant`` or ``undocumented immigrant`` is the more appropriate term to describe the unauthorized immigrant population.  Even though these terms are used to refer to the same population, they seem to have different associations.  How specifically are these terms different?  In other words, what comes to mind when people hear the term ``illegal immigrant`` versus ``undocumented immigrant? ``  This research seeks (1) to develop a further understanding of why and how the terms ``undocumented immigrant`` and ``illegal immigrant`` differ and (2) to explore whether the difference between these terms is related to the perceived criminality\footnote{Unauthorized immigrants are technically not criminals as they have committed a civil offense; a follow-up experiment will be needed to measure whether people can distinguish between committing a civil offense and being a criminal.} of the unauthorized border crossings.  Answering these questions will help create a deeper understanding of two commonly used terms that have consequential effects on how the American public views unauthorized immigrants, which in turn affects immigration policy.  It also may help explain how partisans think differently, which could help people understand where the other side is coming from, even if they do not agree.

In order to explore the differences in perception between ``illegal immigrant`` and ``undocumented immigrant,`` this research will observe how people describe unauthorized immigrants based off whether this population is described as ``illegal`` versus ``undocumented`` and whether they are described as criminals or not.  This can be achieved by using previously established research methods measuring attitudes towards a specific population that have people rate how well certain words describe that population (Peffley et al. 1997, Sears and Henry 2003, Feldman and Huddy 2004, Ommundsen et al. 2014).  By identifying the different associations people have with ``illegal immigrants`` versus ``undocumented immigrants,`` this project can provide a deeper insight about the consequences of using these terms in the current debates surrounding unauthorized immigration.

\section*{1 The importance of language}

Words matter.  Language affects people’s cognitions, which in turn affects how they think and act; language can promote rationalization for a certain kind of political stance (Edelman 1964, Edelman 1971).  Language has the power to create perceptions and beliefs, which can cause people to rationalize certain types of political behavior (Edelman 1964, Edelman 1971).  This means that language can be used to manipulate people (Edelman 1964).  How does language gain such power?  What words mean depend in part on how people interpret them and how they act based on those interpretations (Edelman 1964).  Language creates shared meanings amongst people that are a reflection of their values; these meanings are much more than just their dictionary definitions and can carry emotional connotations (Edelman 1964, Edelman 1971).  People make categorizations based off perceptions, which places an object in a class, thereby suggesting how one judges and defines it; these categories then go on to affect public opinion and public policy (Edelman 1964, Edelman 1977).


In debates about controversial issues, people manipulate their language choice to advocate for certain positions.  In general, how elites message issues to the public can alter people’s political predispositions and affect what stance they take (Stoker 1998, Abrajano et al. 2017).  For example, on both sides of the abortion debate, people make the issue about values by framing the issue as one about ``choice`` versus one about ``life.``  These framing choices have an effect on how people understand and react to certain issues.  For example, whether Ku Klux Klan rallies are framed as a free speech issue or as an issue of disruption to public order affects whether people support them (Nelson et al. 1997).  The debate on unauthorized immigration is no different.  Previous research already shows that elites frame unauthorized immigration to advocate for particular policy decisions (Masuoka and Junn 2013, Merolla et al. 2013) and that how they do so has an effect on public opinion (Knoll et al. 2011, Ommundsen et al. 2014).  In other words, the way unauthorized immigration is discussed has a tangible effect on how the issue is perceived and therefore dealt with in the United States.

\section*{2 Terminology, crime, and border crossings}

This project is largely an expansion upon Ommundsen et al.’s ``Framing Unauthorized Immigrants: The Effects of Labels on Evaluations.``  Ommundsen et al. (2014) administered a survey to 274 undergraduate psychology students in which the respondents received one of three 20-item scales that referred to unauthorized immigrants as ``illegal immigrants,`` ``undocumented immigrants,`` or ``illegal aliens.``  Respondents then had to rate how much they agreed with certain statements about unauthorized immigrants (Immigrant Scale) and about the United States (Patriotism Scale).  Ommundsen et al. (2014) found that respondents who received the ``illegal immigrant`` treatment had the harshest views towards unauthorized immigrants and, surprisingly, that those who received the ``illegal alien`` treatment gave the most favorable ratings; the treatment results were not affected by the respondents’ levels of patriotism.

As suggested by Ommundsen et al. (2014), even though ``illegal immigrant`` and ``undocumented immigrant`` refer to the same populations, these terms vary in several ways.  Some people, mainly elites, use the linguistic implications of these terms in an attempt to sway public opinion, which has an effect on the general public’s attitudes towards this issue (Merolla et al. 2013).  Therefore, these terms differ in both their use and in their understanding.

Those who speak or write about the unauthorized immigration issue are careful to use the term ``illegal immigrant`` or ``undocumented immigrant`` depending upon the message they are trying to convey (Merolla et al. 2013, Nelson and David-Wiley 2018, Raynal 2018).  Conservatives and other opponents of unauthorized immigration use the term ``illegal immigrants`` to envoke negative sentiments by emphasizing the illegality of this group’s actions (Merolla et al. 2013, Nelson and Davis-Wiley 2018).  They often do so to advocate for certain policy decisions, such as stricter immigration enforcement (Koulish 2009, Masuoka and Junn 2013).  This messaging has consequential effects for the people who hear it.  People are less supportive of and more punitive towards immigrants who are described as ``illegal`` instead of ``undocumented`` (Knoll et al. 2011, Ommundsen et al. 2014, Hoops and Braitman 2018).  This could be because ``illegal`` primes people to think in terms of legality (Caicedo 2016).    Sympathizers to unauthorized immigrants oppose this language because they believe it carries negative implications and criminalizes this population (Paspalanova 2007, Koulish 2009, Merolla et al. 2013).  These advocates, usually liberal Democrats, use the term ``undocumented`` to describe this population in more positive contexts (Nelson and Davis-Wiley 2018, Raynal 2018). 

Part of the difference between the use and understanding of ``illegal immigrant`` versus ``undocumented immigrant`` has to do with legality and criminalization (Koulish 2009, Masuoka and Junn 2013, Caicedo 2016, Nelson and Davis-Wiley 2018).  Previous research examining this relationship between immigration and crime has focused on the perceived versus actual crime rates of immigrants - unauthorized and authorized - once they are living in the United States.  It has been widely established that while the public believes immigrants are more prone to committing crimes, immigrants typically have lower crime rates than do native-born Americans (Mears 2001, Reid et al. 2005, Zatz and Smith 2012).  Reid et al. (2015) analyzed 2000 US Census data and 2000 Uniform Crime Report data and found out that immigrants do not increase crime rates and, in fact, sometimes help to lower crime rates.  Zatz and Smith (2012) explored the difference between this reality and people’s rhetoric, finding that the public’s unwarranted panic about immigration has negatively impacted immigrants.
Here, it seems pertinent to address another discrepancy between public rhetoric and reality.  Language has the power to create an appearance of reality that does not match reality itself (Edelman 1977).  As applied to this research, most of unauthorized immigrants are in the U.S. because they overstayed their visas\footnote{In 2017, the Center for Migration Studies of New York found that unauthorized border crossings accounted for 38 percent of unauthorized immigration; overstaying visas made up the majority – 62 percent – of unauthorized immigration in the United States (Warren 2019).}, whereas much of the public date – for example, Trump’s “build the wall” campaign – is focused on border crossings, which in turns makes border crossings seem like the primary threat.  Since this research is focused on language, and much of the language about unauthorized immigration has to do with the border, this specific project will focus on perceptions of those unauthorized immigrants who crossed the border.  Further research will need to be done to address the perceptions of those who overstay their visa since those account for the majority of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S.

Most of the previous literature on border crossing has been about enforcement (Hanson and Spilimergo 1999, Cornelius 2001, Gaytán-Fregoso and Lahiri 2004, Massey et al. 2016) or about the narratives of what happens to people during the crossing (Cornelius 2001).  In other words, research has focused on the logistics of the border crossing, with limited research on the perceptions of unauthorized immigrants’ border crossings.  Harris and Gruenewald (2020) have begun to explore these perceptions by analyzing frames used in media.  They use a time-series trend analysis on the frames used to discuss the relationship between immigration and crime across 2,200 news stories.  They found that frames describing immigrants as being prone to commit crimes have increased, as have frames claiming that unauthorized immigrants are criminals because of their immigration status.  They make the point that the latter claim is false, but there does not appear to be further research on other people’s evaluations of this narrative.

To summarize, previous research has established that ``illegal immigrant`` is a more negative term preferred by conservatives while ``undocumented immigrant`` is a more positive term preferred by liberals.  It has suggested that part of this difference may be related to the fact that the term ``illegal immigrant`` more explicitly refers to the law.  Most of the focus on immigration and the law has centered around the perceived versus actual crime rates of immigrants, unauthorized and authorized, after the move to the United States.  In terms of how they got to the United States, which for some immigrants involved border crossings, past literature on border crossings has focused on enforcement.  This research aims to develop a further understanding of why and how the terms ``illegal immigrant`` and ``undocumented immigrant`` are perceived differently.  It also seeks to combine these different aspects of immigration research to explore whether the perceived criminality of the unauthorized border crossing helps to explain the difference in understanding between these two terms.  In doing so, this research will provide deeper insight into the politically charged terms used in important policy debates. 
 

\section*{3 Methods}

\subsection*{3.1 Research design}

This project measures people’s perceptions of and attitudes towards unauthorized immigrants based off whether this population is described as ``illegal`` versus ``unauthorized`` and whether they are described as criminals or not.  Presumably, people will evaluate unauthorized immigrants more negatively if they read the term ``illegal immigrant`` and are primed to think about the unauthorized border crossing as a crime, whereas people who are presented with the term ``undocumented immigrant`` and are primed to think about them not as criminals will evaluate them more positively.  I will measure this by having participants participate in a four-part survey experiment that measure these evaluations based on which treatment they receive.

This survey experiment was administered to 412 undergraduate political science 
students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in November 2020.  
They took the survey for extra credit.  Students (1) read a vignette about 
unauthorized immigrants, (2) rated how well each of ten words describe that 
population, (3) answered an open-ended question about their general views of 
unauthorized immigrants, and (4) provided some demographic information.

The survey is a 2 x 3 design: 

<<Rchunk2.2, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.keep = TRUE, results = "asis">>=

treatment_matrix <- matrix(c(69, 69, 69, 68, 68, 69), ncol = 3, byrow = FALSE)
colnames(treatment_matrix) <- c("Control", "Criminality", "No criminality")
rownames(treatment_matrix) <- c("Illegal", "Undocumented")
t_table <- as.table(treatment_matrix)

treatment_table <- xtable(t_table, caption = "Treatment sample sizes", digits = c(0,0,0,0))

treatment_table

@

Respondents received one of six treatments.\footnote{The full vignettes, as well as the complete survey, can be found in Appendix A.}  As shown by the table above, 68-69 respondents received each treatment. After reading a vignette, respondents were asked to 
rate how well each of ten adjectives applied to illegal immigrants (for those 
who received vignettes 1, 3, 5) or to undocumented immigrants (for those who 
received vignettes 2, 4, 6).  These ten words were randomized and included 
five positive and five negative: hardworking, honest, intelligent, loyal, 
responsible, lazy, immoral, uneducated, unlawful, and violent.  Participants 
then received an open-ended question to describe their views of the ``typical 
illegal immigrant`` or ``typical undocumented immigrant`` based off which 
treatment they received.  At the end, there were standard demographic questions 
about age, gender, race, ethnicity, party, ideology, and one about immigration 
status.\footnote{Per IRB requirements, none of the questions in any part of the survey were mandatory.  This means that students had the option to skip any questions they did not want to answer and that some questions had less than 412 responses.  I am counting non-responses as missing data, which I am removing my analysis.  I am doing this on a per-question basis, which means that if someone answered one question, but not another, their responses will still count for the ones they answered.}


\subsection*{3.2 Variables}

The independent variables for this survey are the different treatments and the dependent variables are the word ratings and open-ended responses.  To analyze the word ratings, I will conduct difference-of-means test to see if there is a treatment effect on how a word is rated.  I will also compare across words to see if there are certain words that have a bigger difference between treatments, which would indicate those evaluations are more sensitive to what terminology is used.  I will then qualitatively code the open-ended responses to see if there are overarching themes in the way that people describe unauthorized immigrants.  The purpose of adding this open-ended response was to see if people wanted to elaborate on their ratings or add additional information on their views.  Since I provided ten adjectives that I thought were commonly used to describe unauthorized immigrants on both sides, the open-ended responses give participants the chance to add evaluations that I did not include.

These dependent variables can be used to answer my research questions by 
measuring how people think about unauthorized immigration based off how they 
are primed to think about this population.  Stereotypes can be thought of 
as ``pictures in the head`` (Lippmann 1922); language, through political discussions as well as the news, can also create pictures in people's minds (Edelman 1964, Edelman 1977).  This survey seeks to find what 
pops up in people’s minds when they hear ``illegal immigrant`` versus 
``undocumented immigrant.``  Past research has shown that these stereotypes 
can be influenced by priming (Devine 1989), and this 
survey’s $2 \times 3$ design aims to capture the differences in people’s ratings 
depending upon how they were primed.


\subsection*{3.3 Hypotheses}

To reiterate, my research questions are (1) why and how are the terms 
``illegal immigrant`` and ``undocumented immigrant`` perceived differently and 
(2) is part of this difference related to the perceived criminality of the 
unauthorized border crossing.  To answer the first question, I will compare 
the results from the first two treatments.  I hypothesize that respondents 
assigned to the ``illegal immigrant`` treatment will rate negative words as 
more applicable, whereas those assigned to ``undocumented immigrant`` will 
rate the positive ones higher (Hypothesis 1).  Since part of the semantic 
difference in these terms is the explicit reference to legality, I expect 
the words that will have the biggest difference between treatments will be 
ones related to the law, specifically the word unlawful (Hypothesis 2).  
I made sure to choose the word unlawful instead of ``illegal`` or ``criminal`` 
to avoid including words from the vignette.

To answer the second research question, I will make two other comparisons.  
First, I will analyze how prompting no criminality while using ``illegal 
immigrant`` compares to just saying ``illegal immigrant;`` I hypothesize that 
prompting something positive will help soften this negative term and have 
results more similar to the positive term of ``undocumented immigrant`` in 
treatment 2 (Hypothesis 3).  Second, I will measure how prompting criminality
when using the term ``undocumented immigrant`` affects that term; I hypothesize 
that prompting something negative will taint this positive term, making the 
results from treatment 4 look similar to treatment 1: ``illegal immigrant``
(Hypothesis 4).  


\section*{4 Results}

\subsection*{4.1 Word ratings}

\subsubsection*{4.1.1 Terminology comparison: ``Illegal`` vs. ``Undocumented``}

Comparing the word ratings between those who received the “illegal” treatments and those who received the “undocumented” treatments can help to answer the first research question about the specific differences in perception between those two terms.  Hypothesis 1 predicts that respondents who received the ``illegal immigrant`` treatments will rate negative words as being more applicable to the unauthorized immigrant population, whereas those who received the ``undocumented immigrant`` treatments will rate positive words as more applicable.

Figure 1 \footnote{The logical limits for the 95 percent confidence intervals are 1-5, as those are the only values permitted in the survey, but some of the confidence intervals exceed these empirically permitted bounds.} shows the means and 95 percent confidence intervals for the positive words depending upon which treatment the respondents received.  This figure includes data from all six treatments: ``illegal`` includes treatments 1, 3, and 5 and ``undocumented`` includes treatments 2, 4, and 6.  This is to compare the effect of terminology regardless of whether criminality was prompted.  Figure 1 shows very little difference between the means for ``illegal`` versus ``undocumented`` treatments.  Overall, the means were the upper half of ratings, with hardworking being the highest rated word.

Figure 2 \footnote{The logical limits for the 95 percent confidence intervals are 1-5, as those are the only values permitted in the survey, but some of the confidence intervals exceed these empirically permitted bounds.} shows the means and 95 percent confidence intervals for the negative words.  Again, there is little difference between treatments when comparing the means.  Opposite of the positive words, the means of the negative words are in the lower half of ratings.  Uneducated is the highest rated word, perhaps because that is less of a normative evaluation like the other adjective and more so a statement about the reality of unauthorized immigrants' limited access to education.

To compare the difference in word ratings solely based on terminology, we can compare the two control groups 1 and 2, temporarily casting aside the treatment groups.

Figure 3 features a collection of boxplots showing the median ratings and quartiles of treatment 1 versus treatment 2.  Similarly to what was shown in Figures 1-2, positive words received relatively high rankings within the 3-5 range, with hardworking being the highest ranked word.  There was little to no difference across treatments.

Figure 4 shows the medians and quartiles for the negative word ratings.  Here, there is slightly more variation in the distribution of data, even though the means are roughly the same in the end.  For example, violent and unlawful seem to have more diversity in their ratings than do lazy and uneducated.

We can also conduct a difference of means tests to see what the specific values of the differences of means are, if these values are significant, and if these values differ depending upon the specific word.

For the five positive adjectives - hardworking, intelligent, honest, 
responsible, loyal - I expect the difference in means to be negative since 
I hypothesized that the mean for respondents receiving the ``undocumented`` 
treatment to be higher than those who received the ``illegal`` treatment.  I 
am assuming equal variations for these distributions.

This expectation is only true for one of the words: hardworking.  However, 
none of these differences in means is significant as all of the p-values are 
above 0.05.  Additionally - when looking at the 95 percent confidence 
intervals - the value zero is included, which means we cannot reject the null 
hypotheses that there is no effect based on treatment.

For the five negative adjectives - immoral, uneducated, violent, lazy, 
unlawful - I expect the difference in means to be positive since I 
hypothesized that the mean for respondents receiving the ``undocumented`` 
treatment to be higher than those who received the ``illegal`` treatment.  
I am assuming equal variations for these distributions.

This expectation is only true for three of the words: immoral, uneducated, 
and violent.  However, none of these differences in means is significant as 
all of the p-values are above 0.05.  Additionally - when looking at the 95 
percent confidence intervals - the value zero is included, which means we 
cannot reject the null hypotheses that there is no effect based on treatment.

Overall, there is not enough evidence to support Hypothesis 1 or Hypothesis 2.

What happens not only when we vary terminology, but also when we vary whether or not criminality is prompted?

Figure 5 shows a barplot with the distribution of ratings for all of the positive words across all six treatments.  Once again, most of the ratings for the positive words fall within the 3 to 5 range, with hardworking being the highest rated word.  There does not seem to be a difference in the distribution of ratings depending on the treatment.

@

Figure 6 contains barplots showing the ratings for all the negative words across all six treatments.  There does not seem to be a difference between treatments, but there are some different trends among words.  For example, for most of the words the most popular rating was a 1, whereas for uneducated it was 3.  Unlawful also had a wider variety of ratings than did some words such as lazy, which had mostly ratings of 1. This low rating make sense since lazy is the antonym of hardworking, the highest ranked word.

Overall, none of the treatments appear to be having any affect.  To more clearly test Hypotheses 3 and 4, however, we can conduct a difference of means tests.

Comparing the results of treatments 1 and 5 - ``illegal`` and ``illegal`` plus no criminality - can help with Hypotheses 3.

For positive words, I expect a negative difference of means as I expect the 
ratings from the treatment of prompting no criminality to be higher than those 
who received the control of just ``illegal.`` I am assuming equal variations 
for these distributions.

Table 4 shows the differences of means, for the positive words, between treatments 1 and 5.  Only loyal and hardworking had negative difference of means.  Additionally, 
for all of the 95 percent confidence intervals, zero was included and 
therefore we cannot reject the null hypothesis that there is no effect.  None 
of these results are significant anyways due to large p-values all greater 
than 0.05.


For negative words, I expect a positive difference of means as I expect the 
ratings from the treatment of prompting no criminality to be lower than those 
who received the control of just ``illegal.`` I am assuming equal variations 
for these distributions.

Table 5 shows the differences in means, for the negative words, between treatments 2 and 4.  Only one word had the expected positive difference in means: unlawful.  
However, as with all the other results thus far, the 95 percent confidence 
interval's inclusion of zero means we cannot reject the null hypothesis and 
the p-values are too large for the findings to be significant.  Therefore, there is not enough information to support Hypotheses 3.

Moving onto Hypotheses 4, one must analyze the difference in means between treatments 2 and 4: ``undocumented`` versus ``undocumented`` plus criminality.  This time, for positive words I am expecting a positive difference of means as 
I expect the control group to rate positive words higher than the treatment of 
prompting criminality.  I am still assuming equal variance.

Three of the words - honest, responsible, and intelligent - had the expected 
positive difference of means, but the inclusion of zero in the 95 percent 
confidence interval means we cannot reject the null hypothesis and the 
p-values greater than 0.05 means these findings are not significant.

For negative words, I expect the difference to be negative as those receiving 
the prompt criminality treatment may agree more with negative evaluations 
than those in the control group.

This holds true for all of them except unlawful.  However, as will the 
negative results, there is not enough evidence to reject the null-hypothesis 
nor are these findings significant.  Therefore, there is not enough evidence to support Hypothesis 4.


\subsubsection*{4.1.3 Overall word ratings}

Despite these null findings, there is a clear trend for the overall word 
ratings.  Students at UIUC rated positive words more highly than negative 
words.

Table 9 shows the overall means for positive versus negative words. The overall mean for positive adjectives was 3.66 in contrast to the lower mean of 1.96 for negative adjectives.  This suggests that students at 
UIUC have overall positive evaluations of unauthorized immigrants.

\subsubsection*{4.1.4 Open-ended responses}


\subsection*{5 Conclusion}

To summarize, there was not enough evidence to support any of the four hypotheses: the treatments did not seem to have an effect on how respondents rated the applicability of different adjectives to the population of unauthorized immigrants.\footnote{This is assuming each respondent read the entire vignette, therefore ``receiving`` the treatment, which could perhaps be a bold assumption given that the respondents were undergraduate students wanting extra credit.}  However, at least at UIUC, students rate positive words as being more applicable to unauthorized immigrants and rate negative words as less applicable.  

This research will provide a valuable contribution in further understanding how ``illegal immigrant`` and ``undocumented immigrant`` are perceived in the current debate on unauthorized immigration.  Both of these terms are commonly used, yet we do not necessarily know what appears in people’s minds as they use and hear these terms.  In partisan debates, especially with the current levels of outpartisan animosity, it often seems like people on opposing sides are talking past each other; even though ``illegal immigrant`` and ``undocumented immigrant`` are used to refer to the same population, it almost seems like those who use these terms are talking about different people.  This research seeks to understand what pops into people’s minds when they hear these terms to measure whether and how these images of unauthorized immigrants are different.  This can be used (1) to identify what people on opposite sides of the debate are thinking about when discussing unauthorized immigration, which can hopefully lead to understanding – even if not acceptance – of the other side and (2) to understand the considerations people have when forming their opinion on unauthorized immigration, which in turn affects policy.

In addition to answering these questions, there are several next steps for this research project.  One would be to run it with a more representative sample.  Student pools tend to be younger, more liberal, and more educated than the national population, which could skew results especially since unauthorized immigration is a salient issue about which many Americans have already made up their minds.  Analyzing responses from a nationally representative sample could be particularly useful for analyzing partisan differences in responses.  One hypothesis is that Democrats may give relatively higher scores than Republicans on positive words regardless of treatment.  Another is that there could be an opposite effect when a partisan receives the term associated with the other party; for example, a liberal who receives the ``illegal`` term may get offended and give extra-positive results to overcompensate, while a conservative who receives the ``undocumented`` treatment may give even harsher ratings to punish a term they deem to be too politically correct term.  One potential complication with analyzing partisan evaluations is that ``illegal`` and ``undocumented`` may not be inherently different terms, but only differ due to the fact that each party has adopted one of the terms and assigned a particular meaning to it.  This could be challenging to identify and control for.  Nevertheless, administering this survey to a nationally representative sample would still be useful for analyzing partisan differences and also getting a better idea about how the average American perceives these terms differently.

Before administering my survey to a more representative sample, I want to expand my $2 \times 3$ design to a $4 \times 4$ by adding two additional layers.  

<<Rchunk44, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.keep = TRUE, results = "asis">>=

treatment44_matrix <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16), ncol = 4, byrow = FALSE)
colnames(treatment44_matrix) <- c("Control", "Break the law", "Criminality", "No criminality")
rownames(treatment44_matrix) <- c("Illegal (border)", "Undocumented (border)", "Illegal (visa)", "Undocumented (visa)")
t44_table <- as.table(treatment44_matrix)

treatment44_table <- xtable(t44_table, caption = "4x4 design", digits = c(0,0,0,0,0))

treatment44_table

@

The first would be to add treatments referencing unauthorized immigrants who over-stayed their visas. This latter replication would be useful as almost two-thirds of unauthorized immigrants in the United States are people who have overstayed their visa and it would be interesting to see the differences between how people see that population, especially in terms of criminality, compared to those who came here across the border.  It could be helpful when doing this to try to measure if people have different ideas of who they think is overstaying their visa versus crossing the border illegally; the current design could identify the difference in characteristics that people associate with those who cross the border versus overstay their visa, but not necessarily the demographics or identity of those people.  On this notion of perception, it could also be helpful to include a question at the end of the survey asking participants if they know how many unauthorized immigrants came across the border versus through visas in order to measure whether respondents’ knowledge about unauthorized immigrants is accurate; in other words, whether their perception matches reality.  The other addition I am making to this expanded design is to add a measure about ``breaking the law`` to compare with ``criminal;`` unauthorized border crossings are a civil offense, and it would be helpful to see whether people can distinguish between breaking the (civil) law and being a criminal.

Should future iterations of this study produce meaningful results, I would have convincing evidence that language is a powerful political tool.

\section*{7 Appendix A: Survey Instrument}

Below is the full survey experiment.  Please note that the bolding and italics did not show up in the survey itself - I have added them to mark differences in the treatments.  Bolded words point out where the terminology ``illegal`` vs. ``undocumented`` would go - instead of retyping the whole thing - and italic words in the vignettes show what is unique to that pair of vignettes.  The purposes of these bolded and italicized words are to clearly demonstrate the similarities and differences across treatments.

\subsection*{7.1 Part I: Vignette}

\subsubsection*{Treatments 1-2}
Although the exact number is difficult to determine, experts believe there are approximately 11 million \textbf{[illegal/undocumented]} immigrants in the United States. There has been tremendous debate, and a great deal of research, regarding the impact of these \textbf{[illegal/undocumented]} immigrants on the American economy and society. We are interested in your views.

\subsubsection*{Treatments 3-4}
Although the exact number is difficult to determine, experts believe there are approximately 11 million \textbf{[illegal/undocumented]} immigrants in the United States. There has been tremendous debate, and a great deal of research, regarding the impact of these \textbf{[illegal/undocumented]} immigrants on the American economy and society. \emph{One argument advanced by critics of such immigrants is to note that because \textbf{[illegal/undocumented]} immigrants are in the United States without legal authorization, they are breaking the law, which makes them all criminals.} We are interested in your views.

\subsubsection*{Treatments 5-6}
Although the exact number is difficult to determine, experts believe there are approximately 11 million \textbf{[illegal/undocumented]} immigrants in the United States. There has been tremendous debate, and a great deal of research, regarding the impact of these \textbf{[illegal/undocumented]} immigrants on the American economy and society. \emph{One argument advanced by defenders of such immigrants is to note that just because \textbf{[illegal/undocumented]} immigrants are in the United States without legal authorization, that does not make them criminals. This is because violation of U.S. immigration laws is a civil offense, not a criminal offense. No one can be arrested and sent to jail for being an \textbf{[illegal/undocumented]} immigrant.} We are interested in your views.


\subsection*{7.2 Part II: Word ratings}

Please tell us how well each of the following words applies to \textbf{[illegal/undocumented]} immigrants from 1 (not very well) to 5 (very well).

\begin{itemize}
  \item Responsible
  \item Loyal
  \item Unlawful
  \item Intelligent
  \item Honest
  \item Violent
  \item Immoral
  \item Lazy
  \item Hardworking
  \item Uneducated
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{7.3 Open-ended question}

Briefly describe your view of the typical \textbf{[illegal/undocumented]} immigrant. Feel free to elaborate on your responses to the previous question and/or to add new information when writing your description.

\subsection*{7.4 Demographics}

Below are the questions asked in the demographics section.  The responses can be found in Appendix B.

\begin{itemize}
  \item What is your age?
  \item What is your gender?
  \item What is your race?
  \item Are you Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino?
  \item Generally speaking, do you usually think of yourself as a Republican, a Democrat, an independent, or other?
  \item Do you think of yourself as closer to the Republican Party or to the Democratic Party?  (If they answered ``Independent`` to the previous question.)
  \item Where would you place yourself on this scale?
  \item If you had to choose, would you consider yourself a liberal or a conservative?  (If they answered ``Moderate, middle of the road`` to the previous question.)
  \item Which of these statements best describes you?
\end{itemize}
